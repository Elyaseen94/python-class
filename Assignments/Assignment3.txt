Q1: operations on python lists:

1. append(x):
Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].

2.insert(i,x):
Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x).

3.POP([i]):
Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.

4.extend(iterable):
Extend the list by appending all the items from the iterable. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = iterable.

5.String concatenation:
String concatenation means add strings together.
Use the (+) character to add a variable to another variable.

6.count(x):
Return the number of times x appears in the list.

7.sort(*, key=None , reverse=False):
Sort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization, see sorted() for their explanation)

8.revese():
Reverse the elements of the list in place.

9.copy():
Return a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:].

10.remove():
Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x.
