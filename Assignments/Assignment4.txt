# 2D Arrays in python:
Two dimensional array is an array within an array.
#Accessing Values:
The data elements in two dimesnional arrays can be accessed using two indices. 
One index referring to the main or parent array and another index referring to the position of the data element in the inner array.

#operation in 2D Arrays:

1\ Inserting Values:
We can insert new data elements at specific position by using the insert() method and specifying the index.

2\Updating Values:
We can update the entire inner array or some specific data elements of the inner array by reassigning the values using the array index.

3\Deleting the Values:
We can delete the entire inner array or some specific data elements of the inner array by reassigning the values using the del() method with index.

4\Size of a 2-D array
The length of an array can be determined using the len() method.

5\Slicing of a 2-D array in Python
Array slicing is used to access multiple values within an array.

#swich case in python:
The ‘switch case’ statement is like the ‘if… else’ statement but a cleaner and quicker way than ‘if… else’.
The significance of the switch case statement includes:
1\Easy debugging.
2\Easy to read and understand.
3\Easy to maintain.
4\Easy to verify the values to be checked and handled.
