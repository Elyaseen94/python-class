this operation used to divided two numbers>
4. Multiplication(*):
this operation used to multiply two numbers.
5. Modulus(%):
this operation used to get the remindar of division of two numbers.
6. Exponentiation(x^y):
this operation used to get the result of number to power any another number or variable>

Q3: Assigment operation:
1.Assignment Operator (=):
this operation to keep the value of variable in the memory.
2. Addition Assigment operator(+=):
this operation it means add number to the previous number 
for example:
x+=3 it is mean x=x+3 that's means add 3 to the last value of x.
3. subtraction Assigment operator(-=):
this operation it means subtraction number to the previous number 
for example:
x-=3 it is mean x=x-3 that's means subtraction 3 for the last value of x.

this operation it means multiply number to the previous number 
for example:
x*=3 it is mean x=x*3 that's means multiply 3 to the last value of x.
5. division Assigment operator(/=):
this operation it means divided bvariable by the last number 
for example:
x/=3 it is mean x=x/3 that's means divided x by 3.
6.Modulus Assigment operator(%=):
this operation it's mean after divided rounds the number to nearest number.
7.Floor division Assigment operator(x//):
this operation it's get the result of divided in integers number it's means to remove any numbers after decimal point.
8. Exponentiation Assigment operator(**=):
this operation likes the Exponentiation.
for example:
if x=3
x**=3
the result it become 27, how it multiply the value of x three times(3*3*3=27).
